  "description": "The Heckler & Koch MP7 (Maschinenpistole 7) is a personal defence weapon (PDW) chambered for the HK 4.6Ã—30mm armor-piercing cartridge designed by German defence manufacturer Heckler & Koch. It was designed together with the new cartridge to meet NATO requirements published in 1989, as these requirements call for a compact PDW-class firearm, with a greater ability to defeat body armour than the current submachine guns using conventional pistol cartridges. The MP7 went into production in 2001, and is a direct rival to the FN P90, also developed in response to NATO's requirement. The weapon has been revised since its introduction and the latest production variants are the MP7A1 and MP7A2. The proliferation of high-quality body armor has begun to make guns that fire pistol ammunition (such as Heckler & Koch's earlier MP5 submachine gun and USP pistol) ineffective. In response to this trend, Heckler & Koch designed the MP7 (along with the cancelled UCP pistol, which uses the same ammunition) to penetrate body armor while being small enough to be used in place of either a pistol or a submachine gun.",
