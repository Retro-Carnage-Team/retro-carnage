  "description": "The Panzerfaust 44 2A1 (also called Lanze, Leichte Panzerfaust, or Panzerfaust 2) is a recoilless anti-tank weapon. The anti-tank grenade launcher was originally developed around 1960 and put into service by the Bundeswehr in 1963. It was developed to provide West German infantry with a modern replacement for the Bazooka that they had previously used. As such, it was the first German antitank rocket developed after World War II, a conflict in which German hand-held antitank items such as the Panzerfaust played a prominent role during 1944–45. The Lanze was a product of a period in which the German army was re-equipped with locally developed arms and equipment and retired the aging U.S. gear that had formed their initial arsenal. The full designation name by the German Army is Panzerfaust 44mm DM2 Ausführung 1 Lanze.",
