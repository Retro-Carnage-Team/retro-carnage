  "description": "The .30-06 Springfield cartridge (pronounced 'thirty-aught-six'), 7.62×63mm in metric notation, was introduced to the United States Army in 1906 and later standardized; it remained in use until the late-1970s. The '.30' refers to the caliber of the bullet in inches. The '06' refers to the year the cartridge was adopted, 1906. It replaced the .30-03, 6mm Lee Navy, and .30-40 Krag cartridges. The .30-06 remained the U.S. Army's primary rifle and machine gun cartridge for nearly 50 years before being replaced by the 7.62×51mm NATO and 5.56×45mm NATO, both of which remain in current U.S. and NATO service. It remains a very popular sporting round, with ammunition produced by all major manufacturers.",
